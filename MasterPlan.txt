1. App Overview & Objectives

App Name (Placeholder): Online Dukaan
Objective:
To create a platform connecting customers with local shops (general stores, medical stores, bakeries, hardware, stationery, etc.) allowing customers to browse products, place orders with partial upfront payment via Google Pay, and pick them up in-store. The goal is to simplify shopping for busy customers while helping shops increase sales without delivery hassles.

Shops across multiple categories: General/Kirana, Medical, Stationery, Hardware, Bakery.

4. High-Level Technical Stack Recommendations

Payment: Google Pay integration via shop-provided GPay number (manual confirmation).

5. Conceptual Data Model

Entities:

Shop: Details, verification status, GPay number, location, catalog.

Product: Name, description, price, stock status.

Order: Customer, shop, items, partial payment status, ready by time, order history.

Notifications: Push notifications for order updates.

6. UI/UX Design Principles

Simple, minimalistic layout for easy navigation.

Shop and customer dashboards separated logically within the same app.

Product catalog searchable and filterable for large inventories.

Clear “ready by” indicators and order notifications.

Minimal friction in signup/login flow (Gmail initially, OTP later).

Intuitive call-to-action buttons for placing orders, confirming payments, and calling shops.

7. Security Considerations

Verify shops before they appear to customers.

Partial upfront payment ensures customer commitment.
